## [unreleased]

### Fixed

  game not possible to unpause now when message window is open

### Added

### Changed
- more info for jobs  PR #91 by rivenwyrm
- updated to Noesis 3.0.6


### Removed



## [0.8.0]
### Fixed
- Isolated simulation thread from UI thread, so they don't share data.
  UI components are now split into a UI controller living in t he UI thread and a data aggregation component living in the simulation thread.
  Both parts are connected via the Qt message system, but are not allowed to access state owned by the other thread.
- Prevent errors in sprite mapping from cascading. The errors themselves are not resolved yet, but will no longer corrupt an entire save game.
- Always resolve all assets relative to the main executable.
### Added
- Added Noesis based UI, replacing the existing UI from scratch. (Work in progress.)
- Added "Hunting" behavior, in addition to legacy "defend" behavior.
  Squads can actively seek out enemies all over the map as they become visible, without user involvement.
- Added Linux support.
### Changed
- Relicense code under [GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3](LICENSE) and publish as open source.
- Switch to CMake build system.
- Switch from C++11 with MSVC legacy extensions to pure C++17.
- Update Qt to 5.14.1.
- Refactored rendering.
	- Cull empty tiles in vertex rather than fragment shader.
	- Split opaque and transparent tiles into distinct render passes.
	- Upload data to GPU via compute shader rahter than direct mapping.
	- Render dark areas desaturated.
	- Improve visibility of designations.
	- Cull tiles down to minimal screen space size in order to minimize overdraw.
	- Increase required OpenGL version to 4.3.
	- Add depth buffer to rendering.
- Replace explicit squad target control by behavior settings for Squad.
- Move Uniform assignment from squad position to individual gnome.
  Gnomes can now have a uniform without being assigned to a squad, but they still need a squad to control their combat behavior.
- Allow arbitrarily sized squads, up from only 5 slots.
- Speed up high level pathability tests.
- Speed up A* pathfinding.
- Speed up liquid simulation.
- Speed up spatial item lookup.
- Switch from file based SQLite DB to pure in-memory SQLite DB.
- Load SQLite DB from human readable SQL file instead of binary representation.
- Run as "native Windows 10 application" under Windows 10, rather than running in compatibility mode.
