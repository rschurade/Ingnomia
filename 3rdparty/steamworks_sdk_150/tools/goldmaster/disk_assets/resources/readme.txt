Steam Retail Setup File Overview:
---------------------------------

root\Setup.exe :
  The main splash screen setup application launched when the customer inserts
  the disc. Setup detects the current installation state and displays a simple
  menu to install/play/reinstall or uninstall the game. Setup first loads
  setup_default.ini, then the setup_<language>.ini for the language chosen by
  the user, then all other resource files are loaded based on the current
  language configuration. Setup.exe itself does not require admin rights.
  
root\SteamService.exe :
  Helper application to run all additional 3rd party installers from a single
  elevated process under Vista. If you don't need to run 3rd party installers,
  this executable can be removed.

  Used to install Steam on the users machine.

  Tells Windows to run Setup.exe when user inserts disc

root\resources\setup_<language>.ini :  
  These files configure Setup for the chosen language. The files are Unicode
  encoded. They are loaded after setup_default.ini and can override any
