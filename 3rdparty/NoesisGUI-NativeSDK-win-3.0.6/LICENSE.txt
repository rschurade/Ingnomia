This End User License Agreement (the "EULA") effective as of Effective Date, is a legal agreement between you ("Licensee") and NOESIS TECHNOLOGIES S.L.

By installing, copying or otherwise using our Software, you are agreeing to be bound by and comply with the terms and conditions of this EULA, which represents the entire agreement between Licensee and NOESIS, and it supersedes any prior proposal, representation or understanding between the parties. If you do not agree to the terms of this EULA, you are not allowed to install, copy or otherwise use the Software, or any portion thereof.

The Software provides developers the ability to manipulate interfaces and render them using a virtual GPU device driver.

Licensee desires to obtain a non-exclusive, paid-up license to use the Software to develop, distribute, and display applications licensed to third party users ("End Users") or for public display, using the Software to manipulate and render user interfaces under the terms and conditions of this Agreement. 

I. DEFINITIONS

II. LICENSE GRANT
-----------------

1. Development License Grant. NOESIS grants to Licensee a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable, worldwide right and license to use and incorporate the Software to develop Project/s ("Development License").

  1.1. Pursuant to the Development License, Licensee shall be entitled to:
    (a) Incorporate object code of the Software or any part thereof into Project/s;
    (b) Modify the Source Code solely as is necessary to enable the Software in object code format to function as an integral embedded part of the Project (for the avoidance of doubt, Licensee shall not incorporate Source Code into the Project nor distribute Source Code);
    (c) Make and/or develop upgrades, expansions, extensions and/or modifications to Project/s using and/or incorporating the Software provided that such developments operate only as part of the Project/s and shall not operate on a stand-alone basis or be exploited in connection with or as part of any other product;
    (d) Make the number of copies of the Software as is reasonably necessary for use in the development of the Project/s as emergency, back-up, archival or disaster recovery copies only; and
    (e) Allow its contractors to access and use the Software provided that such access and use is solely and exclusively for the benefit of Licensee exercising its right to incorporate the object code of the Software into Project/s.

The license is granted for the version of the Software available at the time this Agreement is entered and for any subsequent updates to the Software to which the Licensee is entitled under this Agreement.

2. Utilization and Integration License. To the extent of Software, or any part or component thereof, is incorporated into the Project/s pursuant to the Development License, NOESIS grants Licensee a paid-up, royalty-free, worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable (except to the extent provided in Section VI), and perpetual right and license to use, copy, distribute and sell the Software in object code only as an integral embedded part of the Project/s ("Utilization License"). 

  2.1 Licensee may sublicense its rights under the Utilization License to:
    (a) End Users;
    (b) Publishers and distributors for the purpose of distributing and selling the Project/s to other distributors and End Users; and
    (c) Its subcontractors for the purpose of advertising, marketing, and promoting the Project/s.

3. NOESIS agrees to provide to the Licensee all of the relevant materials that collectively make up the version of the Software libraries and Source Code that are designed to function under the granted platforms. Such materials shall be provided by means of electronic download.

4. NOESIS agrees to make available for download to the Licensee, at times determined solely by the NOESIS, and at no additional cost, any new version of the Software designed for the platforms stated in this section that are made generally available to new Licensees. 

Licenses granted under this agreement are NOT valid if Licensee is a company or incorporated entity that had a turnover in excess of 100,000 EUROS (One hundred thousand Euros) in their last fiscal year. In the event Licensee makes a turnover in excess of 100,000 EUROS in any subsequent fiscal year, all commercial distribution provisions of this Agreement will be revoked and Licensee must negotiate a full paid license with NOESIS to continue commercial distribution. 

III. NON-DISCLOSURE

3. Licensee acknowledges that the unauthorized disclosure of Confidential Information, whether intentional or accidental, may result in significant and irreparable damages to NOESIS, and that it may be difficult to assign a monetary value to such damages. Therefore, in the event of a breach of this section, NOESIS shall be entitled, without waiving any other rights or remedies, to such injunction or equitable relief as may be deemed proper by a court of competent jurisdiction.

4. Licensee shall not be liable for disclosure of Confidential Information that (i) has been approved for release by written authorization by NOESIS; (ii) becomes part of information in the public domain through no fault of Licensee; (iii) was known by Licensee prior to the disclosure thereof by NOESIS; or (iv) properly comes into the possession of Licensee from a third party which is not under any obligation to maintain the confidentiality of such information. Moreover, Licensee may disclose Confidential Information pursuant to a judicial or other government order, provided that Licensee shall provide NOESIS with prompt notice prior to any disclosure so that NOESIS may seek other legal remedies to maintain the confidentiality of such Confidential Information, and Licensee shall comply with any applicable protective order or equivalent.
